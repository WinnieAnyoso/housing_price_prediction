# housing_price_prediction

### 1) Defining the problem 
As a Data Scientist, you work for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. You have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables. 

### 2) Metrics of success
Be able to create a model that will acurately predict the prices of houses according to the different provided metrics

### 3) Context 
We have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months

### 4) Experimental design
1. Business Understanding: This should give a clear understanding of the data and business in question in order to make conclusive summaries and approaches in tackling the research problem at hand.

2. Reading the data: Reading our data with and aim to understand the variables and observations.

3. Checking our data: This to get details about the dataset, the number of records, the statistal summary,the datatypes in our dataset among others.

4. Tidying up the data (Data cleaning): This was to drop unnecesaary columns, delete duplicate records, get rid of any null values, merge dataframes if need be etc.

5. EDA, the data was analysed, visualized and conclusions were then drawn.

6. Implementing the solution using Regression Analysis(Mulilinear, Ridge, Quantile, ElasticNet, Lasso)

- Check of multicollinearity

- Start building the model

- Cross-validate the model

- Compute RMSE

- Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity

using Bartlettâ€™s test

- Perform appropriate regressions on the data including your justification

7. Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements. Dataset

### 5.Appropriatenes of the data
The data is  is up to date and relevant in making conclusive analyses.
